This project involves running a series of SQL queries on a dataset named Cars24, which contains details about cars for sale, such as the owner type, selling price, car brand, seating capacity, fuel type, and car performance metrics like mileage and power.

The objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights and answer specific questions related to the dataset using SQL queries. Key tasks include:

Filtering Cars by Price and Ownership: Identifying cars where the owner is a "first owner" and the selling price exceeds â‚¹1,500,000.

Seller Type Analysis: Determining how many cars fall under each seller type (e.g., individual, dealer) and listing the various seller types.

Price Categorization: Grouping cars into low, medium, or high-price categories based on predefined criteria.

Price Variation by Model: Finding car models that have different selling prices, along with their lowest and highest prices.

Seat Category Insights: Counting the number of cars in each seat category and calculating their average selling price.

Fuel Category Analysis: Counting the number of cars in each fuel category.

Brand-wise Distribution: Categorizing cars by brand and calculating the number of cars for each brand.

Newest Car Details: Extracting the name, year, and selling price of the newest car in the dataset.

Power and Mileage Similarities: Finding how many cars share the same maximum power and mileage values.

High Performance and Efficiency Cars: Listing cars that have high power (greater than 85) and good mileage (greater than 13 kmpl).
